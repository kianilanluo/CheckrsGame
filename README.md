# CheckrsGame
The Checkers game that pits a human against an AI system
Through interactive gameplay between a human player and a computer opponent, the Checkers game created for this project offers a fun way to examine traditional board game strategies from an artificial intelligence perspective. The laws of traditional checkers, such as required captures, kinging pieces that reach the far side of the board, and multi-step hops, are carefully followed in this adaptation. The game’s graphical user interface, made using Tkinter and written in Python, makes it simple to interact with mouse clicks.
One of the game’s main features is the AI’s tunable difficulty, which can be changed via the user interface. This accommodates a range of skill levels from novice to expert by letting users adjust the depth of the Minimax algorithm’s search to alter the AI’s challenge level. In addition to increasing user engagement, the option to modify AI difficulty enables a customized gaming experience that is adapted to the player’s strategic advancement over time.
